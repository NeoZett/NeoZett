Well, I am Neo, a swedish person that's not to old, <br>
having done much in python, c++, c#, game maker, <br>
unity, *roblox studio* (lol), and much more. <br>
My Story began making java script at <br>
[koda](https://koda.nu).nu which basically was <br>
low calliber, high-level, good ol' java script. <br>
Not much more... But it quickly faded straight <br>
into html, css and soon I made simple web pages... <br>
