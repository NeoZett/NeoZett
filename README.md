## About Me:
**Who am I?** 

Well, I am Neo, a swedish person that's not to old, having done much in python, c++, assembly, game maker, unity, *roblox studio* (lol), and much more.
My Story began making java script at [koda](https://koda.nu).nu which basically was low calliber, high-level, good ol' java script. Not much more... But it quickly faded straight into html, css and soon I made simple web pages... only.. for me to watch..

**So, what do I do?** 

Simple! ~Nothing! -- just a good old boy soon in a buss stop to university, where programming will be having top priotity!
